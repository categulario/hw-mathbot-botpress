# Mathbot

Mathbot is a chatbot with which you can practice multiplication tables. Created for children, or adults too, to practice and master the tables
in a funny way.

Master branch runs with Botpress v1.1. Branch botpressX is a port to that newer Botpress version (but with unsolved issues to show answer variations).

There is also a version being developed using Botkit. https://github.com/roccons/hw-mathbot-botkit/
